Lebowski ipsum yeah man, it really tied the room together. Another Caucasian, Gary. Ahh, you know. Strikes and gutters, ups and downs. D'ya have a good sarsaparilla? Would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course. Do you have any kalhua? I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.

Yeah well, that's just, ya know, like, your opinion, man. Obviously you're not a golfer. …and even if he's a lazy man, and the Dude was certainly that—quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County. Whose toe was it, Walter? Mind if I smoke a jay? Hey! This is a private residence, man! I know my rights. 1972 Pontiac LeBaron. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude.

The nail polish, Walter. Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacifists. Smokey was a conscientious objector. When will you find these guys?

Jesus, man, can you change the station? That guy treats objects like women, man. You got the wrong guy. I'm the Dude, man. That, or Duder. His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing. Yeah man. Well, you know, the Dude abides. You know, little of this, little of that. Walter, this isn't a First Amendment thing. Now this story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early nineties —just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause some- times there's a man—I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?—but sometimes there's a man.

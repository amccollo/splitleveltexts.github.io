            The more we comprehend our own harbors, the better we imagine the contents
            of other worlds.

            It is possible to think of a harbor as an ideology expressed in objects.
            But that does not account for what remains. Each municipality pulses at one
            end of a peristaltic order pushing things from a sea. Families arrive on
            highways unfolding belongings after long transport, emplacing themselves in
            multileveled green and cantilevered neighborhoods, cozying to home, where
            the home is a cavity in the public. And of course there is no warrant for
            any of this. We simply as citizens of an atmosphere collect and do and
            repair, unaware as to what creature we are, even as the harbor remarks the
            distance: brought, catalogued, microcospic, an entablature of nations,
            enrhythmed to planetary want, an agreed area of transfer in the relations
            by which surplus of one region meets and fashions the needs of another.
            <p>

            We may call it "trade" but we don't know what it is. Though we have engaged
            this systematizing of replacement well before writing, and used the sea
            this liquid compound as a basal condition for the mitigation of friction in
            transport loosened by an industry that anticipates the breakage of goods,
            restoring items lost in the trebles of corruption, destruction, neglect,
            such that even the rivers are thin tentacular arrangements by which is
            addressed a continent's systemic losses, we know too this also has nothing
            to do with replacement.

            It is more that the objects of industry enter into flares of preparedness,
            potential interest, use, becoming future subjects of charts, diaries,
            games; they collect in heat and error at hands, causing action, being
            placed on boats, sometimes slight bodies having brought them, lodged before
            eyes on trucks enlarded with the insignia of inland corporations, and then,
            absent notice, these same slide from attention, broken, old, old-fashioned,
            exceeded, discarded in bags, come apart in a batter of particles, found
            dismantled in receptacles, partially oxidized, left near damaged animals at
            the edges of roads. They are leaked from lintels of cabs, impelled in the
            thuds called from the street by potholes, sometimes complementing by their
            mere bruising in daily use the range of humilities exchanged in slaps that
            were themselves summoned from arms, and so spent on faces in small
            percussions of indignation and even justice such that there is a
            self-camouflaged peristalsis to manufacture and decay.&#160;

            And of course evidence of origin dissipates. Everything in the harbor is
            pinned to something else, waits compact and languid, stored for further
            shipment. Inside the embayments the hulls bundle accoutrements of marriage,
            wire rope, parts for lamps, pieces of retaining wall suited for karst
            regions. Pots of glue and other liquid tools of retention are held there in
            harbors replete with pre-pieces, furnitures, vehicular modules, seeds and
            agricultural machine, micrometers and camping grommets, plastic
            contrivances for hair arrangement, small decal, mauls for drusy and thin
            ores, the talocrural sections of manikin, mirrors to expel the human image,
            buttons cut from river mussels, and here the sides of lights, armatures for
            looms, alloyed fixture, jigs and other polygonal templates for the fuss of
            odd motion, each thing of pieces that were themselves assembled after long
            transport and political arrangement; toys to soften the loudness in babies,
            smells from new dyes in piles of damp textile; pads of ruled paper, its
            inks from lakeside soys; new wind turbines whose components were designed
            two decades ago. Maple podiums for schools, crates of garden trowels
            chiefly for those towns established on vast deposits of effluvia, and items
            for the industry that answers the menaces that storms are to industry.

        <p align="justify">
            The ships that walk the storms whose anchors score the harbor muds slide
            now in the spits of otters, laden vessels everywhere tethered over shallow
            dishes of rock, snots and phyllosilicates and metals on their hulls, the
            variants of the same minerals lodged and strewn on the hills above the
            harbors.

            We mostly handle the tools whose use has to do with roads and those
            implements associated principally with kitchens: these two areas of human
            life marked by continual disturbance and effort, matter's linear motion and
            its circulant mixing. What in this smashed original cluster is primary? Can
            we really name one thing that is in our galaxy?

            The atmosphere is a bolster between the harbor's depots and the cities of
            the interior, sounds of lading and transfer dissipate on the tops of
            forests. Across the surrounding plains, down roads and under virga, knocks
            and ringing thin to nothing inside the shelves of shifting wind.

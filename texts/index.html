					<p class="description"> "Poem. Novel. Essay. Here is a literary triptych whose panels swing from one another unfettered by geometry in wide and wild arcs. But there are hinges. Think of the upkeep of the minotaur at the center of what can only be the labyrinthine mind of Lucy Ives. This particular creature feeds on its own enclosure. Who said time is eternity turned into a moving image? How does this work on the page? As soon as Ives allows things focus, she pulls back, revealing a small component of a larger construct, but never anything objective and irreducibly whole. Thus, effectively her subject and obsession is not the demarcation of time, but the inability of time to be properly or comparatively enacted. What if Stein and Paul Éluard were a single poet? What if Wittgenstein, Elaine Scarry, and Charles and Ray Eames collaborated on a novelization of Terry Gilliam’s <em>Time Bandits</em>? What if Robbe-Grillet and Hélène Cixous were to re-write <em>The Duino Elegies</em> as an essay? Daedalus never built anything quite like this. Good luck getting out. —Noah Eli Gordon</p>

					<p class="description"> "<p>In this long poem of poems, each poem page reads as if it could be the last. <em>If Reality</em> represents the end of the world (the end of politics the end of love the end of the poet) in its middle. It is the poem I have wanted to write, the poem that approaches an expression of the pain of the success of Nothing, the united statesian/global obliteration of the shared space of the tragic upon which it proliferates. It is the poem about end, without end. —Rachel Levitsky</p>

					<p class="description"> "Part memoir, part autobiography, and part paean to the late Detroit playwright and poet Ron Allen, W—/M— pits Mnemosyne against Minerva, stringing and unstringing the clothesline of childhood, the lunch lines of adolescence, and the assembly lines of southeastern Michigan. Harryman traces and retraces the line per se as nomadic consciousnesses multiplying beyond the doubles that mark, and thus engender, the self-patrolled borders of identities. At each turn Harryman burrows into the interstices between, among, the grammars that partition normative life from its estranged twin(s). Think of W—/M— as an ode to a thinking that outflanks the actual—and so, makes the actual the center from which all thinking radiates."—Tyrone Williams </p>

					<p class="date">2013</p>
					<p class="description"> "THE LONGEST TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF THE CENTURY continues Catherine Meng's experiments along the radiant edge of how-we-live-now. The book is, among many things, an examination of habit, the daily round of life and language that dulls us to the world. 'Round & round,' she writes. 'We do this again & again.' But it is possible, Meng asserts, to awake in the moment, 'To look up. To say to one's self: this is real. Wanting to touch everything now: the barista's smile, the impossible cake, the change in weather, us, you, whomever you are, reading this, me, twenty years, months, days, hours from now.' THE LONGEST TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE is full of such awakenings, when the world appears new and wild, suddenly freed from the constructs we have invented to tame it."—Jon Davis </p>

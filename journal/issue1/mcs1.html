<p>The frost performs its secret ministry</p>
<p>unhinged by any part. I can’t</p>
<p>recall a single day as any thing</p>
<p>beyond a spectacle of loss. One</p>
<p>has the instant almost held of course</p>
<p>and one has the bliss of ignorant</p>
<p>forgetfulness—but who is that</p>
<p>and what of any of it now—it is</p>
<p>come to facts and facts do not exist</p>
<p>in company to selves—they are a</p>
<p>sheen of details on the lens of one</p>
<p>blank window bordering the inside with the out…</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>having early left one never can</p>
<p>relive the prior instant or relieve</p>
<p>the action of its consequence.</p>
<p>Man, being timely, sticks in time</p>
<p>no counterpart alternative survives</p>
<p>just the memory, receding with each play</p>
<p>of counterfactual chances—ghosts</p>
<p>that never walked the house</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>                                       haunt everyday.</p>

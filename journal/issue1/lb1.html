        <em>According to the same laws by which stars shine </em>
        I have this fantasy of we, space to spread out,
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        unbothered by bodies of bright ships, waters or waking.

        Walking a path defines eyes stuck beneath map, beneath children, between
        paginated
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        husbands.
        <p>

        I open the door to the sea, one kiss on each cheek. You don't know me.
        <p>
        </p>

        A wisp floating was never your idea of a girl returning books to metal
        shelves. The baby deer
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        cries loudly until I turn my head. A child screams and a mother tries, but
        fails, to ignore her.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Cries for who you were, who one might be. Eventually she picks up the
        child.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>

        I've put on my hat and glasses in the seaside library. Everything is too
        bright, except my
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        decision to begin earlier, to rush into language.
        <p>

        They said good morning fondly as if feeling were not invisible. A circle
        punctuated by
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        wonderful births and implausible endings.

        <em>A color I see clairvoyantly</em>
        , another name to say, my finger is banded in miniscule points of light
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

        Every night your body fills with stars and reclines. I find myself along
        the edge of your
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        breakage, between one inhalation and the next.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm here, fully awake, alive for love
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        In stages I move closer and closer to the land. First in my cottage, then
        walking toward the
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        library.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking out on the sound, then, just outside the library on the deck, then
        out onto the knoll
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        an old wooden chair
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Until there is very little distance between my body and the water. Only air
        and light. A few
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        feet further and I would be submerged
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        One oak edges the water, madronna and evergreen
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually I sit exactly on the earth, in an impression in the rock lined
        by gold grass, where I
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        sat yesterday and the day before
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Beneath the banded sky, though stars are not visible in daylight we know
        they are present&#160;
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>

    <p>
        They speak to the water, one tiny moon, and movement along the surface of
        light
        <p>

        <em>Light frequencies of the flower, </em>
        that which is possible in multiple.

        In the morning they appear as rapidly moving white ripples. At night, when
        reflected by
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        moonlight they appear silver. Have I ever seen this exact shade of blue?
        <p>

    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;

    <p>
        I move to the ground so as to be closer to the color.

        Gold moss, empty stalks of hawkflower, past blossoming, and sheep sorrel.
        Pale green lichen

        Rocks in the water are sometimes birds; bull kelp appears to be the head of
        a seal. Today,

    <p>
        blue on the water is tomorrow.

        This impression in the earth was made for pause, one location of stillness.

        Blue electrifies mind, escorts us toward an edge, the place I'd like to
        exist, not glimmering
        <p>

        surface but under the lid of the eye-water-retina, iris.

        A boat moves past and toward the future. A figure stands on deck, an
        arboreal line, with
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        leaf-mast raised.

        Blue continues to explode along the surface, like the after image of
        pleasure.

        The closer we are to the land the more we enter mythology. Spin- with

        "Euphoric Rose" is inspired by Mei-mei Berssenbrugge's book Hello, the
        Roses. Italic text 
        <p>
        (in the first line on every section) is from the title
        poem.

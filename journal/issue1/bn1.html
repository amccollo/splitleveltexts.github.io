										<p class="author">Boyd Nielson</p>

					<p>i.</p>
					
						<p>The ocean was blinding light!<br />
						At noon the seabirds could be seen<br />
						recreating the reflection of the moon.<br />
						Circle, circling.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						<p>ii.</p>


						<p>Halogen rooms sputter in earshot<br />
						of private companies making money<br />
						off the boon of prisoners’ suffering<br />
						because vomit once spilled goes everywhere<br />
						in every crack of the glass shard, held,<br />
						not at all unlike the crimes of banks<br />
						or subprime loans crushed<br />
						between the knees of anthropogenic summer lightning<br />
						when the power grid fails<br />
						bitterness will seem confusing because<br />
						what is the IMF doing when it promotes<br />
						stable growth &amp; frogs die,<br />
						butterflies, bees, gnawing on untrust<br />
						believing in something<br />
						so potent that you bite down hard, &amp; hold<br />
						even afterwards, disillusionment<br />
						in not understanding maneuver suicidal<br />
						phone calls to the point you walk on them<br />
						or crawl on them or fall on them<br />
						because you wouldn’t even know<br />
						where to start without this or<br />
						<em>without you</em>—where to end—<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						
						<p>iv.</p>
						
						<p>The loss is at root<br />
						of language,<br />
						<br /><br />
						impurity existing in time<br />
						in that curvature<br />
						                              are some who live<br />
						as nightmares<br />
						so cleverly joined<br />
						divided. However unlikely.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						<p>v.</p>
						
						<p>NOT ENOUGH TO LIVE ON, NOT ENOUGH TO DIE ON</p>
						<p>Funeral expenses cathect purple body<br />
						once loved or still loved violet capsicum<br />
						&amp; if you want to see pity engorged in straps<br />
						taunted in froth in pointless enthrallment<br />
						an eyelash fluttering to earth a pendulum ui9<br />
						all the pomp of being ignorant to have a thought<br />
						for the bill collector who knows yr name<br />
						&amp; if these dead fingers were my own<br />
						into what kind of havoc would I have them thrown<br />
						dreaming to pull away from my body<br />
						when few are days I don’t hate my dreams<br />
						of falling thru the ground a mouthful of earth<br />
						but imagine if you can, the very body that is you<br />
						impossibly dead like a trace of breath<br />
						over there, somewhere, in corner or distant wind<br />
						just a bill for the makeup on yr stiff skin<br />
						which wages pay for because<br />
						they are the dead living &amp; only in a fantasy<br />
						can you imagine yrself out of them<br />
						a blue lip or a fold of skin,<br />
						untruth curved in the gurgle arc spit truth.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						<p>viii.</p>
						
						<p>ON THE LIE &amp; THE ERROR</p>
						<p>Down the path where<br />
						over two million people<br />
						are incarcerated, do not<br />
						let go of either. The errant<br />
						lie is hard to read, makes reality<br />
						harder to see, shimmering,<br />
						where prices appeared stable<br />
						&amp; realists declared liberation.<br />
						Indigent clip turn block cell.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						<p>xiii.</p>
						
						<p>The sky &amp; sloping shorelines.<br />
						It is enough to know<br />
						that nothing is coming back,<br />
						that resting on what is over<br />
						only means worse on the way.<br />
						Home gets displaced by<br />
						the defibrillator. Language<br />
						gets lost in a hole,<br />
						divorced from the present,<br />
						unable or truly refusing<br />
						to declare it was worth it.<br />
						Many lives overlap<br />
						in the fantasy of saying that once.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						<p>xv.</p>
						
						<p>THE VERY TROTH</p>
						<p>The emptiness a surprise<br />
						the pointlessness, ground down<br />
						absurdity, overbearing hopelessness<br />
						slights, hollowness<br />
						irredeemable memory,<br />
						faults, menial acceptance,<br />
						shock, shaking head,<br />
						years of meaninglessness<br />
						futility’s kingdom, unreality either way.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
						
						<p>xvi.</p>
						
						<p>The knocking in the walls<br />
						&amp; the pipes, the armistice<br />
						troubled by the sound in the bed,<br />
						the floor or the stairs,<br />
						no one will remember the twin<br />
						figures made of toilet paper,<br />
						pitiful attempt at magic, or symbol<br />
						that nothing will ever be true<br />
						again but this upside-down image crossed out.<br />
						The hoax that cd be forsaken doubt.<br />
						<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

        <p>
                The city has sex with everyone.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sex with Kroger.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                All over the city, along the white-paint lines that separate parked cars,
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                parking lots are unzipping.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Between the lines the cars begin to bounce a bit, like babies,
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and from the white lines as they widen and crack and split
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                a milky fescue grows, reedy wet pathways, little streams
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                roseate with lilies, and the streams uprift the concrete
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                in grand dispersing E-shapes, and now across the lot
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                the broken lines extend until they meet&#8212;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                the cars are islanded, really bouncing now
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and Kroger opens all its doors&#8212;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                there's a big sale on&#8212;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                "big sale" is how the Kroger understands itself to be consenting
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                to the city tendril-tunneling its homeless homefree energy into the produce
                wing&#8212;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                the products rapt and blooming breaking open&#8212;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                plastic-wrap unravels on the floor&#8212;a cashier lies down in an expanding
                crack&#8212;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                the milk in there is geothermal warm,
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                it bathes the cashier's nipples,
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                he wafts his hands along the reeds like baby Moses
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and the Pharaoh's daughter who discovers him is fluorescent light
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                reshaping itself (now that the ceiling's gone) into a floating peaceful
                missile
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                congealed of all the city people's formerly constrained mutual care.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Their energy makes the fluorescence glow
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                like an oil puddle
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                ridged in night and sun and opaque peacock fur
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                until the love missile (which is Pharaoh's daughter flow-light)
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                sparks like an old engine
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and ducks and
                dives&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                plays with its comet mates
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                caresses them in cloud and basking sun
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and then remembers the cashier&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and lowers its soft missilic body and takes him
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                into its foggy spider-lightning womb
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                he closes his eyes
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and plans to lead the people
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                but the cloud-missile says rest
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and they listen to percussion
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                of rows of imprisoned colored foodlike items
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                exploding in a fireworky mess, and the stray dogs
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                who lap at Kroger's floor, soft-tonguing, and chew her meat.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>

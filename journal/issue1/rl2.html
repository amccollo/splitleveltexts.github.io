        Not so long ago we were standing. One of us a person and the other a
        screen. This was awkward. One of us, I think the person, says: "It should
        be easy." It reminds me of a feeling she had, for a feeling. Distraction is
        the instance. Story, the result. Everything gets lost. We manage by narrow
        escape. I can't blame you for not helping. We don't speak the same
        language. You don't steer with your clear eyes. Not one of our points is
        from here but, this isn't a poem about mass extinction or which 'cene we're
        in today. It might be about turbulent weather, or the stars last night.
        There were many, they were close.&#160;

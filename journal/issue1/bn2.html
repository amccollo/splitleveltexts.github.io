							<p>Say east or west, the sky<br />
							blue &amp; clouds streak ex<br />
							cept for a few dark as pitch<br />
							as tho bellowed from some<br />
							chimney suspended next<br />

							<p>The brute indifferent extinct<br />

							conceivability that only dis<br />
							torts a future perhaps some<br />
							others will breathe<br />
							                                  as I breathe air.<br />
							Almost April &amp; no sign<br />
							of growth yet that will die<br />
							like Melville’s hopes in prose after<br />
							his early 30s. What kind<br />
							of question wd ask<br />
							whether it wd have mattered cd<br />
							I not write this<br />
							                           or what else &amp;<br />
							none worth a damn<br />
							to be able to see what is gone<br />
							&amp; refusing to see anything else<br />
							to the point of loss.</p>

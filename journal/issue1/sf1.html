		<p>It was a grain of sand<br />
            opened time where the roads cross<br />
            I had no fear of myself but the mirrors terrified me when I looked at all<br />
                    these stories<br />
            Salt was<br />
            a mountain appearing with each picture pulled from memory’s box<br />
            The years harbor ships I journeyed on and others I wished I had seen<br />
                    even from afar</p>
    <br />

            <p><em>Renal failure</em> carved on a coin<br />
            you toss<br />
            pictures you’ll forget are drawn in the air<br />
            When the other mountain rose<br />
            on its peak two boys grown from years of dialysis<br />
            I split from the one who was asleep<br />
            my shadow crossed walls<br />
            returning to a place, or a certain hour</p>

    <br />
            <p>Death was a promise of water that never left his insides</p>
    <br />
            <p>In the dusty place, I perceived a tent<br />
            transparent in the light<br />
            A revolution’s face lit up<br />
            it was a glowing ring whirling<br />
            a voice sprang from a red brick forest’s clamor<br />
            or from the asphalt’s rising columns of white gas<br />
            an instant has fallen from time<br />
            Where have you gone, writer of the letter?<br />
            Where are you now, who sleep in the blue gaze?<br />
            This mountain of faces throws eyes to the street<br />
            to my lens</p>
    <br />
            <p>spits the taste of salt<br />
            on the side of the path</p>
    <br />
            <p>I had a brother…and another brother <br />
            he flew away with the fugitives <br />
            soared from a bed under repair<br />
            there was basil at the <em>Nasser Institute</em><br />
            I had two brothers; now only one with eagles<br />
            I had a vast heart my chest couldn’t hold, the other elsewhere<br />
            She is the one who comes to go<br />
            the un-homeland became a place<br />
            there, a glass of tea and an icon in which I imprisoned my face<br />
            that loved weeping</p>
        
    <br />
            <p>The angel of history runs facing the past<br />
            they’ll come to it carrying on their heads this map<br />
            with this slogan<br />
            that crossed the places of the valley without knife or blade<br />
            yet the grass was the people who want…*</p>
    
    <br />
            <p>Your voice disappeared<br />
            while you hit the wall next to the bed<br />
            screaming with your fists<br />
            I learnt that the disobedience of cities and streets slept in your heart<br /> 
            your body became a tree and your screams<br />
            strayed to the ground of the Square, one after the other<br />
            then dawn water drops on a stone plateau</p>
    
    <br />
            <p>There was a bag I would have carried, climbing over any barrier<br /> 
            I look at you, shrouded and resuscitated<br />
            from a stay of several years<br />
            “You, how are you doing, how are you?”</p> 
            
    <br />
            <p>You were dying voiceless</p>
            <p><br /></p>
    <br />
            <p>* <em>The main slogan in all the Arab revolutions was: The people want the regime to fall.</em></p>

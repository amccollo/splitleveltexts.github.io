        Shredding our shirts into rags and our rags into stuffing
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        we build our dolls or build our nests or build our worlds
        <p>

    <p>
        what property does or doesn't do so many fragments
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        so many children so many feet caught in the tracks
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        despite the warnings despite the sky crying out its own name
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        despite the chirping despite the sound of tears
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the search for meaning in the blurred photo
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        the drawing in crayon that says <em>me and you</em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        and the birds flying in reverse or is it upside down
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        and the approach of Halloween and another stunted season's
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        about to begin spiraling into the ground
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the little one just reaching out for a reassuring hand
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        as we cross the blasted street to where we have no idea
        <p>

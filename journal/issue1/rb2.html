        The titles roll &amp; then the mother
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        sunning in the yard the look behind her eyes a clue to her
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        reliability but she's a good mother
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        she's just eaten the leaves her daughter brings her a clue
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        to surprise &amp; maybe to absence
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        it begins when she asks her daughter what it means to kill
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        cue dark music cue dark sky
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        &amp; they're in the brother's room the little boy they're tidying
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        his room &amp; he's not there but
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the father's there dear father what does it mean to kill
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the daughter doesn't remember
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        her father speaking the daughter guesses what it means to kill
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        in an unclear season a blue room
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the daughter's partly right what it means to kill is to take&#160;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        all the words from other people &amp;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        make them vanish the vanishing comes later &amp; they're dead
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        for a long time the daughter &amp;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        brother &amp; father they're happy sometimes &amp; dead all the time
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        then before the credits roll they've
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        come back into hard-won lives &amp; finally there's a room
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        full of books cue a song &amp; the mother's
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        reading in dim light cue a sad song &amp; the title of everything
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        is how to come back from the dead
        <p>
        </p>

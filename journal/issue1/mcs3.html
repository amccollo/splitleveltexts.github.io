<p>Loosen the reins-lasso<br />
	The roe deer runs to you<br />
	whether you lead or not<br />
	throughout the seas and hillside floods<br />
	all creatures breast the torrents<br />
	after their own kind. Whichever way<br />
	It is for you—and holy criminals<br />
	devote to gods unsettled from their thrones,<br />
	mere dolls, still are they thrall to you.<br />
	All aspects that they lean towards<br />
	cannot escape such truth.<br />
	In folly aimed at Death,<br />
	that witless Tyrant—all are bent on life.<br />
	And life it is that teems their multitudes<br />
	across the myriad plains.</p>
	<p>The sound of the imaginary flute<br />
	I can’t hear anything else<br />
	(would that be bearing false witness?)<br />
	as the sounds peal through their resonance<br />
	high notes above the dancing bear<br />
	that I can’t see possibly in my current circumstance<br />
	his girdle tooled red leather and his muzzle<br />
	weaved of basketry—a small tired black bear from the Urals<br />
	dancing on all fours until encouraged<br />
	to stand proud a mock human the humans mock<br />
	to mock themselves. The flute, the flute<br />
	the bear the flute the bear.</p>
	<p>You cannot preserve the authentic<br />
	Beautiful rain—oh that sound<br />
	Even song will not—down righteous rain<br />
	Fog and tanks—the air raid—fox<br />
	The stage is empty and the audience nil.</p>
	<p>rain will down and dover petals<br />
	libretto quatint the pier collapsed<br />
	no version left—<br />
	Coventry Warwickshire</p>
	<p>(night clothes wet in fields<br />
	night wet sheets<br />
	Wellington boot arcadia)</p>
	<p>So many that died and so few<br />
	That I knew properly—a handful only<br />
	Being Mother—some uncles—Aunts<br />
	But of the passing of those few—too much</p>
	<p>The loathsome sister naked in the hall<br />
	I hear the creaking like a human moan<br />
	Her breasts are hidden by a paper towel<br />
	Her mound the moon of Venus shines</p>
	<p>Wet hair<br />
	Hers is an anguish she self-clasped<br />
	An agony held tight—on pause—the bath<br />
	Is owl white—a dreadful clamour rinses her despair.</p>

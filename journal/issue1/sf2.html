            A witness said: they lived and they died.
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Should the Innocent have to die because he flies over the earth?
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            His mother is walled in the time of flood,
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            the sun is merciless with mortal remains.
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            One <em>Kasr </em>lion* has lost an eye; the two lions lost their Nile
            eyes,
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            the desert is fire and blood, tracks and birds of prey
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            they settle on that Party building still burning
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Arms with hands are weapons, right in "Things fall apart" Square
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            on this impotent day, in this old country, where water, like shame,
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            has dried out, the land's members devoured by wild beasts
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            In the months of March, April, November or December
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            there was a pyramid and an old king who in silence witnessed
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            his dwelling turned into a
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            torture chamber
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the Armed Forces sneak into the yellowed photo,
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            a crescent of wax statues
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            dressed in military uniforms the color of illusion
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            like phantoms arising from a white block of ice
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile those still at time's young edge
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            bring the eagles down with their wings
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>
                &#160;
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sea Islands are velvet cloth; I see feet by the thousands
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            that brush past as they fly toward the Other Time
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            or toward the hour of the dream of death
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            at the dawn of the universe where naked arms embrace paradise
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            where the young ones dream and die
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            where the innocent is martyr
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            where the murderer wanders
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            his head sprinkled with dust
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            where beauty is terrifying
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            the new beginning will not bring them back here
            <p>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            "They die and we live"
            <p>
            </p>

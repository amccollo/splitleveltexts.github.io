<p>
    In a Ferris wheel over the scaffolds of postwar bewilderment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    and disrepair, the star of our movie flashes the word <em>victim</em>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    as one might the authoritative deformity or scar,<em> </em>when Lime,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    also known as impossible Orson Wells, played by doubles
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    in long-shot overcoats and sewers until now, considers the dots,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    also known as people on the ground.&#160; How little it would mean
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    if one, he says, <em>stopped moving, forever</em>.&#160; But nothing
    stops.&#160;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    What we see below is dirt and men at shovels that turn it over
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    without end, digging out some basement garage and crawl space
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    of another era.&#160; They are everywhere, as is the boom-chick
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    and whimper of the zither, caf&#233; anthem of Viennese distraction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    that moves men scene to scene, through the sewage and thrill rides
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    of a fair that cares for no one.&#160; It makes for a stronger entrance,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    the music that brings each friend turned antagonist to meet us.&#160;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It sharpens a smile into someone who knows the art of looking away,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    which is, these days, the art of looking everywhere behind you,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    your shadow the coat of a much taller person.&#160; These days,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    the smart money is on zithers who get a bump from those who love
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    these scarred facades and sentimental waltzes.&#160; Make no mistake.&#160;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This music is transparent.&#160; Practice forever, you still might hear
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    a stutter in the plectrum, still sink at the burden of time you need
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    to fill these measures.&#160; Which is what you tell your exhausted
    neighbor
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    when he pounds the wall to make you stop, that you were just about
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    to get somewhere, to a better Danube of wine bars and sad companions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    You were just about to take a table among the others, the dust
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    of postwar medication in your eyes, when something tips and shatters.&#160;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The cloth goes red.&#160; The chamber of your zither startles like a
    bird.&#160;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    You were looking through the music for a waiter, when you feel
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
        &#160;
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    a hand on your sleeve-a friend, a stranger-and, without thinking,
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    you kneel down, together, and cup the broken embers in your palms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

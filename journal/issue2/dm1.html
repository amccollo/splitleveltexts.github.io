    <p>
        This presence of a garden on our block transforms
    </p>
    <p>
        our sense of urban space so that we no longer feel
    </p>
    <p>
        trapped indoors, without adequate means of
    </p>
    <p>
        escape, unable to transcend the particular property
    </p>
    <p>
        to which we have been assigned. Belonging to a
    </p>
    <p>
        garden means we possess a key. Only those with
    </p>
    <p>
        this key may enter sacred space. This privilege
    </p>
    <p>
        bears responsibilities. We must cultivate our plots
    </p>
    <p>
        each year to continue to be recognized as
    </p>
    <p>
        gardeners. We must perform specific chores to
    </p>
    <p>
        fulfill our obligations of membership.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The garden is close to the ground. Is everything that
    </p>
    <p>
        our apartment buildings are not. Its perimeter is
    </p>
    <p>
        defined by a steel wire fence that separates the
    </p>
    <p>
        outside space of the sidewalk from the inside space
    </p>
    <p>
        that contains wood-framed plots, a tool shed,
    </p>
    <p>
        compost heap and grid of paved and unpaved
    </p>
    <p>
        pathways organized around a central trellis.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The privilege of entering and occupying the space
    </p>
    <p>
        within the garden fence is reinforced by those who
    </p>
    <p>
        pass by, observe us admiringly and cannot enter. They
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        wonder what we are up to &ndash; how this came to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why we are within this privileged space and they
    </p>
    <p>
        remain mere observers on the perimeter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Occasionally, it may come to pass that you are the
    </p>
    <p>
        sole occupant of the garden for a time and are able to
    </p>
    <p>
        enjoy the strange sensation of being alone in what
    </p>
    <p>
        resembles well a prison except that you possess the
    </p>
    <p>
        means to enter and exit at will. Your safety, an illusion
    </p>
    <p>
        perpetrated by a high fence which might be difficult to
    </p>
    <p>
        climb but whose permeable membrane likely offers
    </p>
    <p>
        little protection against outside forces truly wishing to
    </p>
    <p>
        do harm. But fortunately the greatest harm that has
    </p>
    <p>
        been perpetrated by outsiders has been by those who
    </p>
    <p>
        occasionally pick flowers that poke through the gate
    </p>
    <p>
        or climb up and pick the sweet cherries and sour
    </p>
    <p>
        cherries that bloom in May or early June that hang
    </p>
    <p>
        down over the side of the fence. And there is certainly
    </p>
    <p>
        a delight in sharing the fruits of the garden and herbs
    </p>
    <p>
        with those who stop to look and wonder at the
    </p>
    <p>
        marvelousness of a garden such as this in such an
    </p>
    <p>
        unlikely place as the middle of Manhattan.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are also dinners at the picnic tables which
    </p>
    <p>
        primarily the relatively younger occupants use to hold
    </p>
    <p>
        candlelit barbecues in the early evenings with wine
    </p>
    <p>
        and beer. Because, like the thin (nearly invisible) wires
    </p>
    <p>
        that define <em>eruvin</em> in orthodox Jewish communities in
    </p>
    <p>
        Brooklyn &amp; Israel, within which the observant are able
    </p>
    <p>
        to designate once public spaces as private in
    </p>
    <p>
        relationship to Sabbath restrictions &ndash; or like the
    </p>
    <p>
        minimalist sculptures of Fred Sandback who created
    </p>
    <p>
        an altered sense of space through the use of few lines
    </p>
    <p>
        of acrylic yarn or elastic cord	&ndash; within the garden, city
    </p>
    <p>
        open container laws and other regulations that apply
    </p>
    <p>
        to open space cease to apply.
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        The mere fact of the fence defines a private space for
    </p>
    <p>
        all inside that thwarts the rules of the street. And that
    </p>
    <p>
        is why people on the street who pass by and see you
    </p>
    <p>
        enjoying a glass of wine are so utterly charmed by
    </p>
    <p>
        this and puzzled about how this can exist. This
    </p>
    <p>
        possibility of another outside space beyond the small
    </p>
    <p>
        space of the apartment transforms the block and
    </p>
    <p>
        instantly makes it more human. Even when we aren't
    </p>
    <p>
        able to visit the garden for quite a while, it matters
    </p>
    <p>
        deeply to our perception of the block. The fact of its
    </p>
    <p>
        existence speaks possibilities. Allows us to breath a
    </p>
    <p>
        little clearer knowing that we can unlock the gate and
    </p>
    <p>
        take refuge from our homes, from the street, from the
    </p>
    <p>
        perimeter of the block into an interior place.

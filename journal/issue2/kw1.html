She has a Phd in English and American Studies from the CUNY Graduate Center and an MFA in Poetry from the New School. She writes poetry as well as essays on 19th Century American novels and poetry.

Her creative works in process include a book of poems inspired by the lives and discoveries of 18th century astronomers William and Caroline Herschel, and a libretto for an opera entitled You Who Made the Heavens Incline about 9th century Byzantine nun Kassia, who is widely considered to be one of the first famous female composers. She is a 2014 NYFA Poetry Fellow and was recently awarded residencies through The Marble House, The Rauschenberg Foundation, and LMCC.

        <em>
            for Jennifer Firestone
            <p>

        The small circle cutout
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        not the mouth stitched seam but the overlay,
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        a porthole, a saint's medal, the other pressing in
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;

    <p>
        the painting is a telescope, a microscope, a device
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        for seeing the god in the gay body dying of AIDS
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        larger than geography or any attempt at mapping
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>

            &#160;

    </p>
    <p>
        how can one locate oneself in history when
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        history denies, erases you
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        and the others you contain
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        organisms on a dish, the male form giving and taking touch
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the baby, a fetus, in the palm, a violin,
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        a bleeding globe, its objects hanging perverse
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        mobile both holds and drops what it contains
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        in tension; the voice, the text knows it is dying
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        is a breathing organ making of its breath
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        a fight, a righteous fight, a saint's struggle
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        on fire, cigarette in hand
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        where does the self end
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        "I can't abstract my own dying any longer"; "I am standing
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        among all of you waving my invisible arms and hands.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        I am shouting my invisible words"
        <p>

        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        but now I am reading those invisible words
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        made to appear by looking
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the way money is a seamless background, and makes
        <p>

        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        for seamlessness, behind the bad moon rising
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        the clocks that pull away time's orientation
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        or the orientation of the self to time.
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        For time is a petrie dish, the body already skewered
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        with it, with the pleasure of a body,
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        reclining, the traditional subject of art
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
            &#160;
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        an angel diagnosing a message
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; See me
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

        I am

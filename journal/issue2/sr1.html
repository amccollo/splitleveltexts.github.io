                I saw the wind reach through
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                your ears again, and you made a huge
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                smile in words, flashing through your
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                teeth.&#160; It was the unseasoned hour
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                of breathing fish and our gills were
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                choked with massacre, the rain along
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                the avenues coming out red.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                We were getting younger in our palms
                <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                turned and curled in through these
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                mornings or night hours, it was
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                said so, fleeting and winded, you in
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                the sun for a second, having

            </p>
            <p>
                decorations all we could think of

                subtly to that mark. Also it was
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                purple, triangular, gleaming, some

            </p>
            <p>
                kind of wound held together by
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                separation. Never to know the end
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                of it, transitioning back to the
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                inner thoughts made up of

                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                dominoes and concrete leaves.

            </p>
            <p>
                Several thousand people had
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                fit into that square thinking
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                it was a circle of souls.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The bodies separated out
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                and we were left with maps and
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                archives, some branches, and
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                ancient intuitions. These lines
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                weave through yours, and the

            </p>
            <p>
                thinking goes around, far into
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                where we will be.

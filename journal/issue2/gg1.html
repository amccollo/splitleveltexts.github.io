                We know some of the reasons the kestrels do stuff. Though the archive
                beyond that is kind of shallow. Up there in the pellucid wind speckled
                under the growling clouds a flock of darkened avocets seeks Lake Lida. I
                read once that it was the migratory birds who somehow retain in their
                schoolhouse genes and spyglass heads the roots of the great rock and ice
                libraries, who can still trace, out to the arctic hippies, the old lobes
                and cliffs of the melted Laurentide ice sheets, true docents of the
                Cenozoic deeps, the goose and owls such shawled magi just like the comic
                books tell they are.

                There is enough about ourselves to like though down in our towns and
                metallic craft, clanking by our own houses on our way with rashes to have a
                disease, go to a beach, leave behind one who loved us, debrided and
                steaming. And sometimes in the face of all this driving one can wonder what
                was rehearsed and lost in the algorithms of the bears or consider that
                somehow we have stuffed something hard and muffled into the farms.

                It was outside Flom, then, on the farm that formed them, in one of the
                boggier of the adjacent hectares, at autumn, that I came-to at twilight, at
                the edge of a bonfire, the cold smells of muds and smoke mostly the stuff
                that woke me. The cows were decades gone. The nearer silo was beringed with
                dried beaver tails. The birch on the fire, the buttoned tree, its cloth
                peeling to embered pages, plunged upward into the terminator. To seek the
                prized and rare affections found among those proximate to a fire, a being
                has to be politically qualified to approach the commune of the warm: we
                share coats and chairs and food, blankets and worry, in these rare and
                uncertain bubbles of abundance.

                Obviously the question is how does someone find themselves on a farm. Farms
                so readily inhabit the distance that we can't as likely say "here is the
                farm" as "there is the farm." They are such a puzzle of the distance, and
                maybe even of the past, that standing on one it might not be obvious one is
                doing so. Seen just under the horizon, a far clutter of upright barges, as
                if there were a small prolapse in the azimuth, the farm is a conflagration
                frozen in the background, its clarinet tootings and bridge rattlings, the
                runnings before floods, the arrival and carting of ripe and wet babies, its
                meal-smeared furnitures: none of this is heard or seen.
                <p>

                Something about this endless enclosure inspires its requisite apathy. The
                farm resists the observer: it is hard to find a farm. And the farm once
                found is so conceptually smooth it offers few handles by which it can be
                grasped and turned over in the mind. I'm not so sure what the countryside
                is if not a sea of fuel, onerous to cross, not the wilderness, not the
                town, not even a space one could dignify with romantic sobriquets like
                liminal, interstitial, borderland, margin. And what after all has
                guaranteed the flourishing of the farm? They are not like the other islands
                of green that rose in the ice. A mott will crash slowly into a grassland,
                groups of wolves might float, collared locusts, down a creek in single
                file, risen from collected forces that move under rivers or tunnel the
                plains, the cows while here bear milked anchors, a pigs is its own anvil,
                each hen a hatched cannonball, the farmed are the cousins of the
                sea-drowned. The pelagic evening, about the cow, in its special revolution,
                paints a storm on the trees in an orange made by another horizon, a jet
                strokes our passing life with its exhaust, our desks are everywhere
                encrusted with a spilled collection of river relics, the sea washing its
                objects in the wheat, every mattress in the farmhouse was, worked under an
                earlier generation, snagged by arteries, the sleeves in which pity,
                liquefied, is dressed. Then somehow, contiguous across a season, organized
                and smoothened, the caloric shells of lilacs, at the anentropic limits of
                nutrition, are extracted by a circumstance in the weather, even as we do
                what we do on each other's mouths, this calmly disquieting eating of
                something in the other.

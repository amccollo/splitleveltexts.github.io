                The rest of the world (is not) resting.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing I wanted to say is telling.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole of the half I whole in you.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Such is the gasp for breath and then breathing.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The sucking to find succor you are.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                We went to the pharmacy to find cream.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your hair a mane over your ukulele.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The song is the words you find.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The place is the house of love for you.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The world is crying and you know it.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your smile cures ailments.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your eyes accompany the terrible.
                <p>
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                You just you together with us.
                <p>

            <p>
                The oceans of the world are spreading.

                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                The plastic is choking the sea turtles.
                <p>

		What Thay says gets repeated until I can carry it. It's not the same as a
		habit that hurts every instance it is practiced or hurts worse, a spot on a
		lip gets bitten again and again.

		When conditions aren't good, supports that exist cannot be perceived. Or
		was I watching the video that Suzanne sent, replaying Judith Butler walking
		redefining the walk with her companion Sunaura Taylor who was born with
		Arthrogryposis and walks alongside with her high powered chair. You and I
		argue silently; over the cause of our inability to perceive, who said it,
		how it was said, which politics it reveals and if it is politics at all.
		How much of it is love. Possibly love, possibly love tainted by some other
		emotion goddess forgive anger god forbid jealousy. Bloods, bloodletting.
		Events become objects that speak to what gets in our way. Today's random
		appearance is I've nothing to gain. I could say we but won't speak for you
		here. Marielle Franco was assassinated in the street. Not last night, the
		night before.

			<h2>About SplitLevel Texts</h2>

<p>We (Karla and Aaron) started SplitLevel Texts in 2011 as a way to contribute something material back to the poetry world that we love. At the time, we had some clear ideas about what that would mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>publish only work both of us deeply love and believe in</li>
<li>establish another outlet for the capacious experimental lyric tradition we both identify with</li>
<li>publish important new titles and important titles that had fallen out of print</li>
</ul>

<p>We also wanted to pay homage, editorially and in our design aesthetic, to other small presses we'd always admired, like Talisman House, Burning Deck, White Pine, and — yes — New Directions.</p>

<p>We wanted to be open to experiments in the way we published our books (we started by publishing on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso_Book_Machine">Espresso Book Machine</a> before moving on to other digital and offset printing models).</p>

<p>Finally, we wanted to price our books modestly. Poetry is essential.</p>

<p>SplitLevel Texts is a practical extension of what we do as writers, and we hope you're interested. Our titles are warehoused and sold by our friends at <a href="http://www.spdbooks.org/">Small Press Distribution</a>.</p>

<p>We don't publish very many books, as you can see, but if you'd like to query us about a manuscript, please let us know: queries AT splitleveltexts dot com.</p>
